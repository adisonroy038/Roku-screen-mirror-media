You can cast or screen mirror media to your Roku TV or streaming player.

The terms casting and screen mirroring are commonly used interchangeably because they mostly do the same thing but they are slight differences.

Casting allows you to direct or cast a song a photo a video a movie or TV show that you're watching on a supported app on your smart phone or tablet to your Roku TV or streaming player. This happens wirelessly over a Wi-Fi network after the media starts playing on your Roku TV you can use your mobile device for something else or you can switch it off. The content on your TV will continue playing and you can control playback with your Roku remote Or the Roku app.

 
Screen mirroring on the other hand does the same thing as casting just in a different way screen mirroring also known as Miracast. Although Roku  doesn't use this term. It enables you to replicate or mirror everything you see on a compatible smart phone or tablet on your Roku TV screen. The keyword here is everything so whatever you see on your mobile device is what appears on the big screen TV. This also happens wirelessly over a Wi-Fi network. 

 
Following steps will help you differentiate how casting and screen mirroring work on your Roku TV. If your  Roku Streaming device is connected to your laptop as your setup to cast media from your smart phone to the Roku stick, you have to use a media app that supports casting. Most popular media apps and services such as YouTube, Netflix, Plex, Disney plus, Facebook, and spotify all support casting. You can tell if the app supports casting if you see a little Cast icon appears somewhere on the video screen.

 

	Any app installed on your smart phone and your Roku TV or streaming player

	Must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network otherwise The Cast icon won't

Appear and you won't be able to cast content to your Roku TV. To cast media to your Roku TV from your  simply start the app from your Android phone and then tap on The Cast icon over the video that is playing and then select which Roku device that you want to cast to. Then your video will start casting on your Roku TV. You will receive an alert on your TV that says new device connected and it lists your device's name up there and in a few seconds the video will start playing on your Roku TV. 


You can control playback you can control volume you can pause play using your smart phone as actually a remote and it totally really works. While casting you can actually multitask on your phone it means that you can use your phone for other tasks you can grade emails you can write documents you can do lots of other things on your phone while the video is playing on your Roku TV so that is one advantage about casting a video to your Roku TV.

 

If you want to disconnect or to stop casting a specific video to your Roku TV

Open the app again. Then just go to that video that is playing and see it says playing on Roku Streaming device, tap on it the Cast icon will appear over the video. Tap on The Cast icon and then just down there tap on disconnect the video will now continue playing on your smart phone but it will disconnect on your Roku TV.   You can see it says device disconnected.  

Screen mirroring is limited to compatible Android and Windows PC devices. You need an Android phone that is Miracast certified and supports Android 4.2 or later basically any phone released in the last five years will work. You will also need a screen mirroring or Miracast receiver which typically is your smart TV. Most current generation Roku streaming players in Roku TVs  support screen mirroring with notable exceptions being some 2017 models of the Roku Express. You can find the model of your Roku device by going to settings and then system and then you can check the Roku product page if your model supports screen mirroring or Miracast. Lastly like casting your smart phone or Roku device must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network for screen mirroring to work.
